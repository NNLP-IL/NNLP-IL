# NNLP-IL (National Natural Language Processing plan of Israel)

NNLP-IL is a national initiative for the creation of infrastructure, research and development of advanced capabilities for the advancement of the field of NLP in Hebrew and Arabic.

We know what you're thinking.. (Why in english? :woman_facepalming:) - as for now we have decided english will work best for the NNLP-IL open source community, for more (Hebrew) information see [NNLP-IL Homepage](https://www.nationalplanil.ai/) (Arabic version is coming soon..).


## Why Is There a Need for a National Plan?
NLP in Hebrew (and to a lesser extent also in Arabic) is left behind. The major breakthrough that will allow significant use has not yet been made, the cost of fitting and customizing each use case on its own is very high.

### The Core Reasons
* Hebrew and Arabic are difficult languages (rich in morphology), most of the technological development is with morphologically thin languages.
* Modern language models require vast datasets. The accessible data in Hebrew is very limited.
* The industry's economic interest in investing in NLP in Hebrew (and to some extent also in Arabic) is limited compared to other common languages, since it is a relatively small market.

## Guiding Prinicples
* Generic framework that will allow fitting and customizing solutions to various applications (without focusing on specific use cases).
* Open sourced (as much as possible) - Everyone can take part, contribute and use.
* Break through the data barrier - creating tagged and untagged datasets and make them accessible to the general public.
* Usability - distributing capabilities through manuals, convenient packaging of code and more.

## Who's taking part?
The NNLP-IL is an initiative of:
* Israel Innovation Authority.
* The Ministry of Innovation, Science & Technology.
* The Israeli Ministry of Defence Directorate of Defense Research and Development (DDR&D).

## Active Projects
* Index of open tools and resources for Natural Language Processing in Hebrew - The resources index that was created and managed by [Shay Palachi](https://github.com/shaypal5) and the [NLPH community](https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH) is now maintained by the NNLP-IL community (:pray: Thanks for the kickstarting the NNLP-IL community with it's first major comtibution).
